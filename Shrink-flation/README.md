Write a query to identify products that have undergone shrink-flation over the last year. Shrink-flation is defined as a reduction in product size while maintaining or increasing the price.

Include a flag for Shrinkflation. This should be a boolean value (True or False) indicating whether the product has undergone shrink-flation

The output should have the columns Product_Name, Size_Change_Percentage, Price_Change_Percentage, and Shrinkflation_Flag.

Round percentages to the nearest whole number and order the output on the product names alphabetically.
