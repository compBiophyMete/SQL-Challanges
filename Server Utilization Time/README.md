Amazon Web Services (AWS) is powered by fleets of servers. Senior management has requested data-driven solutions to optimize server usage.

Write a query that calculates the total time that the fleet of servers was running. The output should be in units of full days.

Assumptions:

Each server might start and stop several times.
The total time in which the server fleet is running can be calculated as the sum of each server's uptime.
