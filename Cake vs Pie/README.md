Marcie's Bakery is having a contest at her store. Whichever dessert sells more each day will be on discount tomorrow. She needs to identify which dessert is selling more.

Write a query to report the difference between the number of Cakes and Pies sold each day.

Output should include the date sold, the difference between cakes and pies, and which one sold more (cake or pie). The difference should be a positive number.

Return the result table ordered by Date_Sold.

Columns in output should be date_sold, difference, and sold_more.
