Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different category, write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

Within the "appliance" category, the top two highest-grossing products are "refrigerator" and "washing machine."

In the "electronics" category, the top two highest-grossing products are "vacuum" and "wireless headset."

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
